README - Hospital Management System (Mandem Hospital)
=====================================================================

Purpose of the Program:
--------------------------
This program is a basic Hospital Management System built using Python. 
It simulates a hospital environment where users can:
- Register new patients and doctors
- Book and cancel appointments
- View patient profiles and doctor schedules
- Generate bills for completed appointments

The system is menu-driven and runs from the command line interface.

How to Run the Program:
--------------------------
1. Open a Python environment (Thonny, VS Code, PyCharm etc.)
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Save the Python script as 'hospital_system.py'.
4. Run the program by executing:
   'python hospital_system.py'

5. Use the menu options displayed to interact with the system.

Required Modifications:
--------------------------
To enhance or modify the program in the future, consider the following:
- Add file handling to store patient/doctor/appointment data persistently.
- Introduce login or role-based access (e.g. receptionist vs doctor).
- Improve the billing system with service itemization and tax handling.
- Add search functionality for patients or appointments.
- Replace the console interface with a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt.

Assumptions and Limitations:
-------------------------------
- The program stores all data in memory during runtime. Once closed, all data is lost.
- It assumes user inputs are provided accurately according to prompts.
- Each doctor can only have one appointment per time slot.
- Gender is limited to "Male" or "Female" during registration.
- The billing process relies on manual input for extra charges.
